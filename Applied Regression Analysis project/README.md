Applied Regression Analysis project

- This is the final project I did in the course Applied Regression Analysis in my first year in the M.S. Biostatistics program in 4/2016. 
  - I used the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to find risk factors for poor mental health. I used SAS to build a statistical model and wrote a formal report on the results styled as a statistical manuscript. In my final model, hours worked, hours slept, age group, education level, smoking frequency, number of days in a month bad physical health, and an interaction between hours slept and number of days in a month bad physical health were found to be significant. However, since my final model not meet the assumptions of linear regression the results were actually invalid.
