Applied Regression Analysis project

- This is the final project I did in the course Applied Regression Analysis in my first year in the M.S. Biostatistics program in 4/2016. 
 - I used the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to find risk factors for poor mental health. I used SAS to build a statistical model and wrote a formal report on the results styled as a statistical manuscript. In my final model, hours worked, hours slept, age group, education level, smoking frequency, number of days in a month bad physical health, and an interaction between hours slept and number of days in a month bad physical health were found to be significant. However, since my final model not meet the assumptions of linear regression the results were actually invalid.

Udacity Project 1

- The first project I did with Udacity in 10/2017
  - I extracted weather data from the Udacity database using SQL with the goal of finding the 7-day moving average for Columbus, Berlin, Belgrade, Tunis, and globally. I imported the data into R using  readr and used dyplyr, ggplot2, Hmisc to answer the question and additional analysis such as building a simple linear regression statistical model and then wrote a report on the results. I found that Columbus is hotter on average compared to the global average.
  
Udacity Project 3

- The third project I did with Udacity in 12/2017
  - I used the TMDB movie data to discover which genres when paired with the genre that contributes the most profit drives the average rating upward.  I cleaned 11000 rows of data and then used NumPy and Pandas to answer that question. I also used matplotlib and plotnine to visualize the data. I created a report using jupyter notebook and found that Adventure contributes the most to profit. Animation, drama, family, fantasy, mystery, science fiction, war, and western are the genres when paired with Adventure drives the Adventure genre upward.
