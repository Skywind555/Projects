Applied Regression Analysis project

- This is the final project I did in the course Applied Regression Analysis in my first year in the M.S. Biostatistics program in 4/2016. 
  - I analyzed a publicly available dataset using SAS and wrote a formal report on the results styled as a statistical manuscript (SAS code no longer available)

Udacity Project 1

- The first project I did with Udacity in 10/2017
  - I extracted data from a database using SQL and analyzed the data using R. I wrote a report of the results showing an understanding of the analysis in context
  
Udacity Project 3

- The third project I did with Udacity in 12/2017
  - I posed a question about a dataset, then used numpy and pandas to answer that question based on data and created a report to share the results using jupyter notebook.
