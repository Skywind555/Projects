Springboard project 2

- This is the second project I did for Springboard's Data Science Career Track from 4/2018 to 5/2018
  - I cleaned over a million rows of data from different sources and combined them into a single data frame using Pandas, Glob, and NumPy. Using Dash, I created an interactive visualization dashboard useful for exploratory data analysis. I performed negative binomial regression on total crimes committed as the response to determine what factors influence total crime count. I found that gas prices, state, and year were the only significant predictors.The visualization application is located at https://finding-crime-trends.herokuapp.com/
The Tableau story I created using the same dataset is located at https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel.jin3384#!/vizhome/AnIncreaseofRapeintheUSAVersion3/Story1?publish=yes
