Springboard project 2

- This is the second project I'm currently working on for Springboard's Data Science Career Track from 4/2018 to current
  - I cleaned over a million rows of data from different sources and combined them into a single data frame. Using Dash, I created an
  interactive visualization dashboard useful for exploratory data analysis. It is located at https://finding-crime-trends.herokuapp.com/
