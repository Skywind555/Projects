Springboard project 1

- This is the first project I did for Springboard's Data Science Career Track from 2/2018 to 3/2018.
  - I used video game sales with ratings data from Kaggle to find the best set of predictors for Global Sales and compare predictive power from a statistical model to machine learning models. I cleaned 16719 rows of data and used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotnine to conduct an exploratory data analysis. I split the data into 80% train and 20% test and used statsmodels to build the best multiple linear regression model I could. I used sci-kit learn to build many machine learning models including linear, ridge, support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting regressor models. In the end, I found that all the machine learning models performed better than the statistical model with random forest regression with the lowest MSE. My results were not completely conclusive because I wasn't able to validate the statistical model.
