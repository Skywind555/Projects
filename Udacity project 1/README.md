Udacity Project 1

- The first project I did with Udacity in 10/2017
  - I extracted weather data from the Udacity database using SQL with the goal of finding the 7-day moving average for Columbus, Berlin, Belgrade, Tunis, and globally. I imported the data into R using  readr and used dyplyr, ggplot2, Hmisc to answer the question and additional analysis such as building a simple linear regression statistical model and then wrote a report on the results. I found that Columbus is hotter on average compared to the global average.
