Udacity Project 3

- The third project I did with Udacity in 12/2017
  - I used the TMDB movie data to discover which genres when paired with the genre that contributes the most profit drives the average rating upward.  I cleaned 11000 rows of data and then used NumPy and Pandas to answer that question. I also used matplotlib and plotnine to visualize the data. I created a report using jupyter notebook and found that Adventure contributes the most to profit. Animation, drama, family, fantasy, mystery, science fiction, war, and western are the genres when paired with Adventure drives the Adventure genre upward.
