Udacity Project 5

- The fifth project I did with Udacity in 3/2018
 - I used a red wine quality dataset from Udacity to determine what chemical properties influence the quality of red wines. I performed exploratory data analysis in R while documenting my exploration and analysis in a RMD file. I utilized univariate, bivariate, and multivariate means to find patterns in the data. With bivariate analysis, I found that higher quality wines are associated with higher fixed acidity, lower volatile acidity, higher citric acid, less chlorides, higher alcohol content, higher sulphates, and lower density. With multivariate analysis, I found that higher quality wine on average exhibit a total sulfur dioxide of between 15 to 50 depending on the ratio of free sulfur dioxide to total sulfur dioxide which should be between 0.15 and 0.75 and that after adjusting for alcohol content, higher quality wines tend to have a low amount of residual sugar compared to lower quality wines.
