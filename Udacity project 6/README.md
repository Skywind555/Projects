 Udacity Project 6
 
 - The sixth project I did with Udacity in 4/2018
  - I gathered three WeRateDogs twitter datasets including querying the Twitter API using Tweepy. I assessed data quality issues in a jupyter notebook and then cleaned the datasets before merging them into one dataset. I discovered a few insights about the wrangled data which includes that the Golden Retriever was the most frequently predicted dog.
